        <p><center>The official Kerala emblem is a derivative version of the Royal coat of arms of the Kingdom of Travancore. 
	The state emblem symbolizes two elephants guarding the state emblem of India and the emblem of Tranvancore Kingdom (a dextrally-coiled silver) conch shell (Turbinella pyrum) ). 
	The current emblem of Kerala was adopted in 1960 when Pattom A. 
	Thanu Pillai's government came to power after the removal of communist government by Union Government.</center></p>
